Tools for converting gems to native packages. Currently only RPM is supposed.

mkgemrpms.sh will download the gem and any of its dependencies and convert all
of those to rpms.

For example:

  % mkgemrpms.sh eventmachine-tail
  Building eventmachine-tail >= 0
  ...

  % ls RPMS/*/*.rpm
  RPMS/noarch/rubygem-eventmachine-tail-0.2.20100525165012-0.2.20100525165012-20100617140122.el5.noarch.rpm
  RPMS/noarch/rubygem-rake-0.8.7-0.8.7-20100617140129.el5.noarch.rpm
  RPMS/x86_64/rubygem-eventmachine-0.12.10-0.12.10-20100617140030.el5.x86_64.rpm


'rake' was built because some gems require rake but don't specify that, so it
was easier to simply hack that rake is always packaged.

We will never rebuild a package. That is, as long as RPMS/*/*.rpm has an rpm
that provides rubygem(gemname) = someversion, any attempt to build a gem of
that version will be skipped.
